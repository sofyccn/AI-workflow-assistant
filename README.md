An AI-powered web app that helps teams design, run, and track **multi-step workflows** from plain-language descriptions.  
Built as a startup-style MVP to showcase **AI integration, full-stack development, and cloud deployment** skills.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Natural Language to Workflow**  
  Type a description like _"Onboard a new software engineer"_ and the app generates suggested workflow steps using an AI model (OpenAI GPT).

- **Multi-Step Workflow Execution**  
  Store and run workflows composed of manual, AI-generated, or API steps. Tasks are tracked with statuses (`pending â†’ running â†’ done`).

- **Progress Tracking**  
  Each workflow shows its steps in order with live updates and an activity log.

- **Cloud-Ready Architecture**  
  Backend + frontend are containerized with Docker and deployable to platforms like Fly.io, Render, or Heroku.
